# DEFIMON - DeFi Monitoring and Trading Platform

## Architecture Overview

DEFIMON is a multi-service architecture built with Java 8 + Spring Boot and Rust for high-performance operations.

### Services:

1. **API Gateway** (Java/Spring Cloud Gateway) - Entry point for all client requests
2. **Blockchain Sync Service** (Rust) - Blockchain data synchronization and indexing
3. **Transaction Signing Service** (Rust) - Secure transaction signing
4. **Math Computing Service** (Rust) - High-speed mathematical calculations
5. **Data Aggregation Service** (Rust) - Real-time data processing and aggregation
6. **Apache Kafka** - Message broker for inter-service communication
7. **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for chain data storage

### Technology Stack:

- **Java 8** with Spring Boot 2.x
- **Rust** for performance-critical services
- **Apache Kafka** for messaging
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL storage
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** for API routing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- At least 4GB RAM available
- Infura account (for Ethereum RPC access)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x start-services.sh stop-services.sh

# Start all services
./start-services.sh

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Stop all services
./stop-services.sh
```

### Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update `ETH_RPC_URL` with your Infura project ID
3. Modify other settings as needed

### API Access
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health
- **Full API Documentation**: See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Service Communication

All inter-service communication happens through Apache Kafka topics:
- `blockchain-events` - Blockchain synchronization events
- `transaction-signing-requests` - Transaction signing requests
- `math-computation-requests` - Mathematical computation tasks
- `aggregated-data` - Processed data streams
- `service-status` - Health and performance metrics
